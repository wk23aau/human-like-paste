# Human-Like Paste

Overview
--------

Welcome to **Human-Like Paste**â€”a VS Code extension that revolutionizes the way you paste text. This extension types out your clipboard content with natural delays and variability, mimicking human keystrokes for a more dynamic and interactive experience. No extra setup required!

Features
--------

### **Zero-Config Experience**

*   If the server is not activated, copy/paste functions normally.
    

### **Main Paste Simulation (Server Mode)**

*   **Start (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S)** â€“ Activates the server.
    
    *   If a simulation is paused, you can either **Resume** from the last point or **Restart** from scratch.
        
*   **Paste (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V)** â€“ Initiates the simulated typing effect.
    
    *   If a simulation is paused, regular paste occurs instead.
        
*   **Stop (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+X)** â€“ Stops the simulation and clears its context.
    

### **Special One-Time Paste Commands**

*   **Special Copy (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q)** â€“ Saves the clipboard content into a special instance.
    
*   **Special Paste (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+W)** â€“ Pastes using the special instance (or the clipboard if none is set), regardless of server status.
    
    *   Runs independently of the main simulation and can be paused, resumed, or stopped separately.
        
    *   If paused, prompts to **Resume** or **Restart** the special paste.
        

### **Additional Controls**

*   **Resume (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+.)** â€“ Resumes a paused simulation, prioritizing the special simulation if active.
    
*   **Pause (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P)** â€“ Pauses an ongoing simulation, prioritizing the special simulation if active.
    
*   **Toggle Notifications (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Z)** â€“ Enables or disables on-screen notifications.
    
*   **Adjust Typing Speed:**
    
    *   Increase: **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up**
        
    *   Decrease: **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Down**
        
    *   Alternatively, modify the **Speed Factor** in settings (Range: **0.1 â€“ 5.0**).

*   If not activated, normal pasting remains unchanged.
    

### **3\. Start a Simulated Paste**

*   With the server active, press **Ctrl+V / Cmd+V** to simulate typing.
    
*   If a simulation is paused, regular pasting occurs until resumed or restarted.
    

### **4\. Utilize Special Paste Commands**

*   **Special Copy (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q)** â€“ Captures the clipboard for a one-time paste.
    
*   **Special Paste (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+W)** â€“ Always executes a simulated paste using the special instance.
